Rear motors use TIM16 and TIM17, steering motor uses TIM15. For rear motors
base frequency is 240 Mhz, after a prescaler of 6000 counter frequency is 40
kHz. Minimal achievable speed is 2.4 mm/s (0.61 ticks/s). Maximum speed
allowing less than 3% difference between consecutive settings is 4.9 m/s.
(1250 ticks/s). Microstepping is obviously disabled.

Steering motor: TIM15.
ENA - PE2, DIR - PE4, PUL - PE5.

Rear left: TIM16.
ALM - PB4, ENA - PE0, DIR - PE1, PUL - PB6.

Rear right: TIM17.
ALM - PB5, ENA - PB3, DIR - PD7, PUL - PB7.

16.12.2024: Found a problem, PB8 and PB9 are pulled up to 3.3V on the board for
usage in camera I2C. Solution: use the alternative outputs of the timers,
TIM16_CH1N on PB6 and TIM17_CH1N on PB7. Change rear left motor's ENA and DIR
signals to PE0 and PE1. The pinout above is updated.

17.12.2024: Stopped using PE3 as steering motor's DIR because of conflict with
onboard LED. Updated the pinout.
